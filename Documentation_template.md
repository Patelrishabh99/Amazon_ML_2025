## 1. Executive Summary

_We developed an innovative Image-to-Price AI pipeline that combines advanced OCR technology with ensemble machine learning to predict e-commerce product pricing. Our solution transforms product packaging images into structured features using computer vision and natural language processing, then applies a sophisticated voting ensemble optimized for SMAPE to deliver accurate price predictions. This multimodal approach eliminates manual data entry and provides instant market intelligence._

## 2. Methodology Overview

### 2.1 Problem Analysis

_We identified product pricing as a complex function combining explicit product attributes with implicit market positioning signals. Traditional pricing models overlook the rich semantic information embedded in product packaging and descriptions._

**Key Observations:**

- Product descriptions contain sophisticated marketing language indicating premium positioning

- Visual packaging elements correlate with brand perception and price tiers

- Health certifications (organic, gluten-free) significantly impact price points

- Weight/quantity information follows predictable pricing patterns across categories

- Premium terminology ("gourmet", "artisan", "premium") correlates with 15-30% price premium

### 2.2 Solution Strategy

**Approach Type**: Multi-modal Feature Fusion with Ensemble Learning
**Core Innovation**: Real-time OCR-to-Price pipeline that extracts structured features from product images and processes them through an optimized ensemble model specifically tuned for e-commerce pricing patterns\*
